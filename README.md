# lolcode-interpreter

An interpreter for LOLCODE, written in Python.

## Status
- [x] Lexer
- [x] Parser
- [x] Initial command-line interpreter (still in development)
- [x] Initial frontend (editor, tokens, syntax tree)

## Requirements

Python 3 with the standard library. No additional packages are required.

## Command-line usage

Run the included sample program:

```sh
python3 -B interpreter.py source.txt
```

You can replace `source.txt` with the path to your own LOLCODE file. Running
without a filename also uses `source.txt`. The sample prompts for input near
the end through `GIMMEH`.

The initial interpreter implements variables, assignments, typecasts,
arithmetic and Boolean expressions, comparisons, string concatenation,
console input/output, conditionals, switches, loops, and function calls.
It is still in development; full LOLCODE compatibility is not yet verified.

To inspect the sample's tokens or syntax tree separately:

```sh
python3 -B lexer.py
python3 -B parser.py
```

## Web workbench

Start the local frontend with Python (no additional packages needed):

```sh
python3 -B app.py
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser. Stop the server with Ctrl+C.

- Write LOLCODE or load one of the included examples.
- Click **Analyze code**, or press Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on macOS).
- Inspect the token table and syntax tree, or read lexer/parser errors.
- Open a `.lol` or `.txt` file, and save your editor contents as `playground.lol`.

The workbench uses the Python lexer and parser. It checks syntax;
program execution is currently available through the command-line interpreter.
Keep a saved copy of your code before
closing or refreshing the page. The server listens on localhost for local use.

Run the frontend API checks with:

```sh
python3 -B -m unittest test_app.py
```

## Repository housekeeping

`.gitignore` excludes Python caches, virtual environments, build output,
local environment files, and operating system metadata. Keep source code,
sample programs, tests, and documentation under version control.
